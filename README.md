# chapel_barba_navier_stokes
A Chapel port of the Lorena A. Barba group's: ***[CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier-Stokes](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/)*** Tutorial

# Goals

- Serve as a fun and practical introduction to [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/)
   - especially for those who are already familiar with Python and Numpy
- Show how some basic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers could be implemented in Chapel
- Expose some of Chapel's features for distributed-memory computation (in the `*_distributed` examples)
